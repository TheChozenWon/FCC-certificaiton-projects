          Akira Toriyama (Japanese: 鳥山明, Hepburn: Toriyama Akira, April 5,
          1955 – March 1, 2024[1]) was a Japanese manga artist and character
          designer. He first achieved mainstream recognition for creating the
          popular manga series Dr. Slump, before going on to create Dragon Ball
          (his most famous work) and acting as a character designer for several
          popular video games such as the Dragon Quest series, Chrono Trigger,
          and Blue Dragon. Toriyama came to be regarded as one of the most
          important authors in the history of manga with his works highly
          influential and popular, particularly Dragon Ball, which many manga
          artists cite as a source of inspiration.
